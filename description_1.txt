Before you start
- Try not to read ahead.
- Do one task at a time. The trick is to learn to work incrementally.
- There is no need to test for invalid inputs for this kata, assume the string you receive is correctly formatted.

1. Create a simple String calculator with a method int Add(string numbers)
- The method can take 0, 1 or 2 numbers, and will return their sum (for an empty string it will return 0) for example “” or “1” or “1,2”
- Start with the simplest test case of an empty string and move to one and two numbers
- Remember to solve things as simply as possible
- Remember to refactor after each passing test

Open "dont_read_yet_description_2.txt" when done.
