4. Support different delimiters
- To change a delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line that looks like this: “//[delimiter]\n[numbers…]”.
  - For example “//;\n1;2” should return three since the delimiter is ‘;’ .
- The first line is optional, so all existing scenarios should still be supported, (existing tests should still pass).

Open "dont_read_yet_description_5.txt" when done.
